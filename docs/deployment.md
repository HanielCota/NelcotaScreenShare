# Deployment and operations

Production guide: Coolify on a VPS, with self-hosted LiveKit, the app as a GHCR image and Postgres managed by Coolify. To run locally, see the [development guide](development.md).

## Deploying on Coolify

You will create two resources on the same server: LiveKit and the app.

### 0. DNS and keys

1. Create two A records pointing to the VPS IP:
   - `app.yourdomain.com` → React Router app
   - `lk.yourdomain.com` → LiveKit (signaling + TURN)

   If you use Cloudflare, leave `lk.` as DNS only (grey cloud). TURN and WebRTC need the real IP.

2. Generate a key pair:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm livekit/livekit-server:v1.13.7 generate-keys
   # or: echo "API$(openssl rand -hex 6)"  and  openssl rand -base64 48
   ```

### 1. VPS firewall

```bash
ufw allow 7881/tcp           # WebRTC over TCP (fallback)
ufw allow 50000:50100/udp    # WebRTC media
ufw allow 3478/udp           # TURN/UDP
ufw allow 30000:30100/udp    # TURN relay ports
ufw allow 5349/tcp           # TURN/TLS (only if enabled, see below)
```

Do **not** open 7880: it goes through Coolify's HTTPS proxy. If your provider has its own firewall (Hetzner, AWS etc.), open the same ports there too.

### 2. LiveKit resource (Docker Compose)

1. - New Resource → Docker Compose pointing to this repository.
2. In _Docker Compose Location_, use `/docker-compose.livekit.yml`.
3. Edit `deploy/livekit/livekit.yaml` and replace `lk.yourdomain.com` with your domain (`turn.domain`).
4. In Environment Variables, set `LIVEKIT_API_KEY` and `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`.
5. Don't fill in a domain on the service. With `network_mode: host`, the proxy can't discover the container through labels; the route is created in step 3.
6. Deploy. The logs should show `starting LiveKit server` with `rtc.portICERange: [50000, 50100]` and `Starting TURN server`.

### 3. HTTPS proxy for `lk.yourdomain.com` → 7880

In Servers → (your server) → Proxy → Dynamic Configurations, add a `livekit.yaml` file (Traefik):

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    livekit-http:
      rule: Host(`lk.yourdomain.com`)
      entryPoints: [http]
      middlewares: [livekit-https]
      service: livekit
    livekit:
      rule: Host(`lk.yourdomain.com`)
      entryPoints: [https]
      service: livekit
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt
  middlewares:
    livekit-https:
      redirectScheme:
        scheme: https
  services:
    livekit:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://host.docker.internal:7880
```

Coolify's proxy already resolves `host.docker.internal` to the host. If it doesn't on your server, use the Docker bridge gateway (`http://172.17.0.1:7880`) and allow traffic from the containers to 7880:

```bash
ufw allow from 172.16.0.0/12 to any port 7880 proto tcp
ufw allow from 10.0.0.0/8 to any port 7880 proto tcp
```

To test: `curl https://lk.yourdomain.com` should respond `OK`.

### 4. App resource (GHCR image)

The image is built on **GitHub Actions** (not on the VPS, so it doesn't compete with the app for CPU and memory) and published to GHCR with two tags: `:<sha>` (immutable) and `:main`.

1. In Coolify: New Resource → **Docker Image** → `ghcr.io/<org>/<repo>:main` (with a GHCR read credential). Ports Exposes: `3000`. Domains: `https://app.yourdomain.com`.
2. Environment Variables (runtime):

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://nelcota_app:<password>@<postgres-internal-host>:5432/nelcota
   LIVEKIT_API_KEY=<same as LiveKit>
   LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=<same as LiveKit>
   LIVEKIT_URL=wss://lk.yourdomain.com
   ACCESS_PASSWORD=<optional>
   MAX_PARTICIPANTS=6
   SENTRY_DSN=<optional>
   AUTH_SECRET=<openssl rand -base64 48>
   ADMIN_AUTH_SECRET=<another openssl rand -base64 48; enables /admin>
   APP_URL=https://app.yourdomain.com
   RESEND_API_KEY=<sending-only key scoped to your verified domain>
   MAIL_FROM=Nelcota <no-reply@yourdomain.com>
   ```

   `APP_URL` is required in production. For Resend, verify the sender's domain with the DNS records supplied by Resend, create a sending-only API key scoped to that domain, and set `RESEND_API_KEY` and `MAIL_FROM` as runtime secrets. The server calls the [Resend Email API](https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/emails/send-email) over HTTPS; keep `SMTP_URL` unset. For SMTP instead, set `SMTP_URL` and `MAIL_FROM` and leave `RESEND_API_KEY` unset. Configuring both providers fails validation. Enabling delivery does not change `REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION`.

   E-mail delivery is optional: leave `RESEND_API_KEY`, `SMTP_URL`, and `MAIL_FROM` unset and keep `REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=false` to run without delivery. Password recovery and account e-mails cannot be delivered in this mode; message contents and recovery links are not logged in production. A provider and sender are required before enabling e-mail verification (`server/env.server.ts`).

3. Keep rolling updates on (no host port mapping and no fixed container name). The Dockerfile's `HEALTHCHECK` queries `/api/health`; the container runs as a non-root user (`nelcota`).

**Pipeline** (`.github/workflows`): `ci.yml` runs formatting, lint, types, `pnpm audit`, tests (with Postgres 18.6) and build on every PR. On `main`, `deploy.yml` does: image to GHCR → **migration** (SSH to the VPS, `docker run` of the new image with the migration user) → Coolify webhook → waits for `/api/ready` to respond with the new SHA. If the migration fails, nothing is deployed.

GitHub secrets (`production` environment): `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`, `DEPLOY_KNOWN_HOSTS`, `DEPLOY_HOST`, `DEPLOY_USER`, `MIGRATOR_DATABASE_URL`, `COOLIFY_DEPLOY_WEBHOOK`, `COOLIFY_TOKEN`. Variables: `APP_URL`, `DEPLOY_DOCKER_NETWORK` (default `coolify`), `PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` (optional). On the server, the deploy user needs `docker login ghcr.io` once.

> The rate limit is in memory: it holds for a single replica (the Coolify default). To scale horizontally, switch to Redis.
>
> The IP used for rate limiting is taken from `X-Forwarded-For` counting from the end, according to `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` (Traefik = 1). If `app.` also goes through the Cloudflare proxy, use `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS=2`.
>
> **Rollback:** the `:main` tag changes on every deploy. To go back a version, point the resource to `ghcr.io/<org>/<repo>:<previous-sha>` (immutable tag) and redeploy; migrations are always additive (expand/contract), so the previous code works with the new schema.

### 4.1. PostgreSQL

1. In Coolify, create a **PostgreSQL** resource with the `postgres:18.6-alpine` image, in the same project and server as the app. Do **not** make the port public.
2. In "Custom PostgreSQL configuration", paste `deploy/postgres/postgresql.conf` (it **replaces** the whole file; the values are annotated for 4 and 8 GB VPSs). Restart the database.
3. Run the bootstrap once as the superuser (instructions at the top of `deploy/postgres/bootstrap.sql`) and save the three generated passwords.
4. The App's `DATABASE_URL` uses `nelcota_app`; `MIGRATOR_DATABASE_URL` (GitHub secret) uses `nelcota_migrator`. Both with the Postgres **internal** host.
5. Enable Coolify's scheduled backups to an S3-compatible store (daily, 03:00).

### 5. TURN/TLS (optional, for very restrictive networks)

TURN/UDP (3478) is already on. TURN/TLS on 5349 gets through firewalls that only let TLS through, but it needs a valid certificate for `turn.domain`:

1. Generate the certificate with a DNS challenge, since port 80 belongs to the proxy:
   `certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d lk.yourdomain.com`
   (or use your DNS provider's plugin, for automatic renewal).
2. In `deploy/livekit/livekit.yaml`, uncomment `tls_port`, `cert_file` and `key_file`.
3. In `docker-compose.livekit.yml`, uncomment the certificates volume.
4. Open `5349/tcp` and redeploy.

### 6. Webhook (rooms and participations in the panel)

The app receives LiveKit events at `POST /api/livekit/webhook`. Each event is stored in `livekit_events` (the event id prevents duplicates) and projected into `rooms`, `room_participations` and `share_sessions`, which feed the admin panel. The projection accepts repeated and out-of-order events. The signature is checked with `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`/`LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`: without it, the route responds 401. With the database down, it responds 503 and LiveKit retries.

1. In `deploy/livekit/livekit.yaml`, replace `api_key` in the `webhook` block with the value of `LIVEKIT_API_KEY` and the URL with the app's domain.
2. Redeploy LiveKit.
3. Check: join a room and run `select event, processed_at, error from livekit_events order by received_at desc limit 5;`.

In development, `deploy/livekit/livekit.dev.yaml` points the webhook to `http://host.docker.internal:3000` (see the top of the file).

Every request to `/api/token` is also stored in `token_requests` (result, account and IP), which ties each join to its source IP.

## Testing in production

### Two different networks

1. Computer A on the home/office Wi-Fi; computer or phone B on 4G (phone hotspot).
2. Both join the same room. A shares the screen; B should see the stage within seconds.
3. Also test from a corporate network/VPN, which is where TURN is usually needed.

### Checking `relay` (TURN) candidates

1. In Chrome, open `chrome://webrtc-internals` **before** joining the room.
2. Join and share the screen. On the `RTCPeerConnection` connection, open Stats Tables and look for the `candidate-pair` with `state: succeeded` / `nominated: true`.
3. Look at that pair's `remote-candidate` / `local-candidate`:
   - `candidateType: host` or `srflx` → direct connection over UDP (ideal);
   - `candidateType: relay` → went through TURN.
4. To **force** a TURN test, temporarily block direct media on the VPS and reconnect:

   ```bash
   ufw deny 50000:50100/udp && ufw deny 7881/tcp
   # join the room: the nominated pair should be "relay"
   ufw delete deny 50000:50100/udp && ufw delete deny 7881/tcp
   ```

   If it doesn't connect with those ports blocked, check `3478/udp`, `30000-30100/udp` and `turn.domain`.

5. From the server: in the LiveKit logs, each person's `participant active` line includes `connectionType` (`udp`/`tcp`) and the `publisherCandidates` list. The candidate marked `[remote][selected:1]` shows the type used (`host`, `srflx` or `relay`).
