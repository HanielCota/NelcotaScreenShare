# Development

Everything you need to run, test and maintain the code. The folder layout is in the [architecture guide](README.md) and the decisions in [`adr/`](adr/).

## Running locally

Prerequisites: Node 26.9+, pnpm 12.9.1 (`npm install -g pnpm@12.9.1`) and Docker.

```bash
# 1. LiveKit in dev mode (the key must be 32+ characters; the app validates this)
docker run -d --name lk-dev \
  -p 7880:7880 -p 7881:7881 -p 7882:7882/udp \
  livekit/livekit-server:v1.13.7 \
  --dev --bind 0.0.0.0 --node-ip 127.0.0.1 \
  --keys "devkey: devsecret-0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"

# 2. Local Postgres (same configuration and roles as production)
pnpm db:bootstrap:dev        # docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --wait

# 3. Variables
cp .env.example .env.local
#   LIVEKIT_API_KEY=devkey
#   LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=devsecret-0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
#   LIVEKIT_URL=ws://localhost:7880
#   DATABASE_URL=postgres://nelcota_app:app-dev@127.0.0.1:54329/nelcota
#   MIGRATOR_DATABASE_URL=postgres://nelcota_migrator:migrator-dev@127.0.0.1:54329/nelcota
#   TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://nelcota:nelcota-dev@127.0.0.1:54329/nelcota_test

# 4. App
pnpm install
pnpm db:migrate     # migrations with the migration user
pnpm db:seed        # optional: sample participants (password from SEED_PASSWORD, or a random one it prints), rooms and audit entries
pnpm dev            # http://localhost:3000
```

Open two tabs (or a private window), join the same room and share your screen.

| `LOG_LEVEL`                  | no         | Log level (default `info` in production, `debug` in dev)                                                                                                          |

| `TEST_DATABASE_URL`          | tests      | **Disposable** database for integration tests; Vitest recreates databases from it. Not read by the app                                                            |

The app's variables are validated with Zod in `server/env.server.ts`. If something is missing, the container exits with code 1 at boot and lists the problem in the logs.

`LIVEKIT_URL` is read at runtime by the server and returned to the browser along with the token. So changing the URL doesn't require a rebuild, and no variable needs to exist at build time.

## Tests

- `tests/unit`: no database (pure domain: token decision, mascot rules, room protocol…).
- `tests/integration`: real Postgres. With `TEST_DATABASE_URL` (a **disposable** database; in dev it is read from `.env.local`), Vitest recreates an already-migrated template database and each test file gets a clean copy (`CREATE DATABASE … TEMPLATE`). Without the variable, it warns that only the unit tests will run. One of the tests runs as `nelcota_app` to check the grants.
- `tests/e2e`: Playwright with dev Postgres and LiveKit running. It starts the app on `127.0.0.1:3100` with its own database (`nelcota_e2e`, recreated on every run) and Chromium with a fake microphone and screen. If the port is taken, set `E2E_PORT` in the environment before running the tests. Install the browser once with `pnpm exec playwright install chromium`.

## Formatting

The formatting rules for AI agents are in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md); CI also runs `pnpm format:check`.

## Oxlint

`oxlint.config.ts` is the main configuration, compatible with the installed Oxlint 1.87.
It covers `app`, `components` (including `components/ui`), `features`, `lib`, `server`, tests
and configuration files. Build output, dependencies, coverage and temporary captures are left out.

Beyond code quality, the linter enforces the architecture boundaries, size and complexity limits listed in
[ADR 0003](adr/0003-oxlint-boundaries.md).

The rules check Hooks and effect dependencies, circular and duplicate imports,
accessibility (including `Link`, `Input` and `Label`),
explicit `any` and unused variables. In full mode, they also check unhandled
Promises, unsafe type operations and unnecessary suppression comments.
Warnings make the command fail, including in fast mode. Parameters and variables
that are intentionally unused can start with `_`.

`typecheck` stays separate (`tsc --noEmit`): it doesn't depend on Oxlint's experimental
type-check. `useGSAP` receives dependencies in a configuration object; it is not added
to `additionalHooks`, which expects the signature with a dependency array.

The exceptions are local: the initial focus of the microphone, reactions and
share popovers allows keyboard navigation. In `SignUpForm`, the autocomplete rule
is off because [Oxlint's implementation](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/blob/main/crates/oxc_linter/src/rules/jsx_a11y/autocomplete_valid.rs)
rejects `nickname`, which is [valid in the HTML standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofill-detail-tokens).
Remove the exception once Oxlint accepts that token.

`oxlint.fast.config.mjs` reuses the main configuration and turns off only the type
engine and unused-suppression detection, since suppressions of type-aware rules
cannot be evaluated in that mode. Use `pnpm lint:fast` for quick local feedback;
it doesn't replace `pnpm lint` or `pnpm typecheck`.

If Windows shows "Controle de Aplicativo bloqueou este arquivo" ("Application Control blocked this file") when starting
`tsgolint.exe`, the full lint fails because of an operating-system restriction.
In that environment you can run `pnpm lint:fast` and `pnpm typecheck` separately,
but validating the type-aware rules requires an environment that allows that executable.
[Windows Smart App Control](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-malware-protection/smart-app-control-frequently-asked-questions)
doesn't offer individual exceptions; on managed machines, ask the administrator
responsible for the application policy. For full validation in CI, run `pnpm lint`,
`pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` and `pnpm build`.

> In production and locally, `pnpm start` runs the Hono server built from `app/server.ts` (`build/server/index.js`, port from `PORT`). The Docker image includes only production dependencies, the SSR build, assets and the migration scripts.
